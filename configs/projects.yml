      title: HealthTrust
      description: The HealthTrust project focused on building a data-driven risk assessment tool to evaluate the operational health of Bay Area nonprofits. Using survey data, the team identified key risk categories including leadership burnout, financial instability, and compliance challenges. A scoring model was developed to quantify organizational risk and help prioritize technical assistance and funding. Tableau dashboards and data visualizations were created to synthesize findings for HealthTrust’s internal strategy and grantee engagement. The final deliverable provides actionable insights to support capacity-building across the nonprofit ecosystem.

      title: Tilli
      description: The Tilli project aimed to develop an AI-powered tool that digitizes and grades handwritten K–5 math exams, with feedback delivered via WhatsApp. The team experimented with both public and HuggingFace OCR/LLM models to evaluate their performance on diverse handwriting styles. Key challenges included interpreting multilingual, messy handwriting and generating clear, SEL-aligned feedback. The final recommendation was a hybrid model strategy combining fast OCR with deep reasoning models like Claude and GPT. The deliverable provides a foundation for Tilli’s MVP, with a focus on scalability, low-bandwidth environments, and personalized learning insights.

      title: Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction
      description: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world, making early prediction and prevention crucial in reducing mortality rates. This project focuses on analyzing heart disease risk factors and developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart attacks. Using a dataset from Kaggle, we will apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to identify high-risk patients based on key health indicators. For the data analysis portion, we will leverage Data100 methodologies and industry-recognized libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more to explore trends and correlations within the dataset. Our machine learning pipeline will experiment with various models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and other classification algorithms, to evaluate performance and optimize predictions.

      title: Sustianable Space Debris Management
      description: The growing concern over space debris has significant commercial implications, as the sustainability of space activities is crucial for both governmental and private sector stakeholders. With over 23,000 tracked objects 10cm or greater as of July 2023, and the incident in August 2023 where space debris came close to the International Space Station, there is an increasing recognition of the need for active debris removal. The Kessler Syndrome, which describes a cascade of collisions due to high object density in low Earth orbit, poses a direct threat to the infrastructure of space agencies like NASA, SpaceX, and the European Space Agency, both of whom are actively seeking solutions to combat this problem. The potential for commercial ventures in this area is substantial, as these agencies are looking to develop technologies for debris monitoring, mitigation, and removal.
