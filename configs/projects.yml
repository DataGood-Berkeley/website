      title: Sustianable Space Debris Management
      description: The growing concern over space debris has significant commercial implications, as the sustainability of space activities is crucial for both governmental and private sector stakeholders. With over 23,000 tracked objects 10cm or greater as of July 2023, and the incident in August 2023 where space debris came close to the International Space Station, there is an increasing recognition of the need for active debris removal. The Kessler Syndrome, which describes a cascade of collisions due to high object density in low Earth orbit, poses a direct threat to the infrastructure of space agencies like NASA, SpaceX, and the European Space Agency, both of whom are actively seeking solutions to combat this problem. The potential for commercial ventures in this area is substantial, as these agencies are looking to develop technologies for debris monitoring, mitigation, and removal.
