			The DataGood team offers a <span flicker>valuable</span> service to nonprofits. Organizations that are working to make the world a better place donâ€™t necessarily have access to <span flicker>high quality</span> data science tools and this volunteer group is working to change that. I found their work to be <span flicker>prompt</span>, <span flicker>professional</span>, and most importantly <span flicker>very useful</span>!

		<p> Our Education branch aids our members in developing foundational data science and software development skills. Each lecture focuses on a unique application of data science in an impact driven sector. In addition, our take-home labs directly tackle current socioeconomic issues and initiatives so students can get a glimpse into a practical use of the lecture content. At the end of the foundational series, our members complete a final capstone project showcasing their newly developed skills!
