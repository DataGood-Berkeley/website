		<p>“The DataGood team offers a valuable service to nonprofits. Organizations that are working to make the world a better place don’t necessarily have access to high quality data science tools and this volunteer group is working to change that. I found their work to be prompt, professional, and most importantly very useful! ~ Sarah Pita, Development Director for Nehemiah Gateway USA
