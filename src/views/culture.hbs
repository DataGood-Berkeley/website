      <h2>Lineages</h2>
      <p>
        Each semester, returning members and new members may choose to be matched
        together through our big/little system. This tradition builds strong
        mentorship, guidance, and lifelong friendships within the club.

      <h2>Retreat</h2>
      <p>
        Once a semester, we go on a weekend-long trip where we hike, swim, roast
        marshmallows, and enjoy the outdoors together. Retreats give members a
        chance to bond outside of academics and form lasting memories.

      <h2>Socials</h2>
      <p>
        From our big welcome night to smaller group hangouts, socials keep our
        community strong throughout the semester. Theyâ€™re a fun way to relax and
        connect with people across and within project groups.

      <h2>Banquet</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of each semester, we celebrate our hard work with a banquet.
        Members showcase their projects, reflect on achievements, and celebrate
        friendships.
