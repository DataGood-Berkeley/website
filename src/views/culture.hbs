  <p>
    At DataGood, we strive to cultivate a culture where meaningful connections flourish 
    across all membership levels, whether you're new to the team or a returning member. 
    We strike a thoughtful balance between wholesome community and lively, fun energy, 
    ensuring that everyone feels welcome, supported, and excited to participate. 
    Through a system of social points and incentives, we make engagement not just 
    meaningful but rewarding, encouraging members to show up, contribute, and grow 
    together. While we proudly celebrate our traditions and the values that shaped us, 
    we’re always evolving, creating an inclusive and dynamic space where everyone can 
    belong, lead, and make an impact.

      <h2>Lineages</h2>
      <p>
        Each semester, returning members and new members may choose to be matched
        together through our big/little system. This tradition builds strong
        mentorship, guidance, and lifelong friendships within the club.

      <h2>Retreat</h2>
      <p>
        Once a semester, we go on a weekend-long trip where we hike, swim, roast
        marshmallows, and enjoy the outdoors together. Retreats give members a
        chance to bond outside of academics and form lasting memories.

      <p>
        From our big welcome night to smaller group hangouts, socials keep our
        community strong throughout the semester. They’re a fun way to relax and
        connect with people across and within project groups.
